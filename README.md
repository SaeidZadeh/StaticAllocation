# StaticAllocation
The code for the paper Optimal Algorithm Allocation for Robotic Network Cloud Systems
We start by describing the graph of all algorithms, average execution time of each algorithm to be executed on each node, 
the average communication time (data transmission speed) between two adjacent node, and the constraints on the memory. The code 
is developed to solve static allocation of a fix graph of algorithms on non isomorphic randomly generated architectures. The 
solution can be obtained using a single architecture with known constraints on memory and data transmission speed. The result will 
be the solution with the minimum response time and memory usage by all the edge nodes.
All packages (libraries) to run the code are included in the code.
